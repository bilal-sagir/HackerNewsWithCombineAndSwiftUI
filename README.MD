# First Application with SwiftUI and Combine 

### Purpose of This Project

Showing the news from Hackernews in a list and showing the inbound link of the relevant topic on the detail page with the help of WKWebView.
I just started learning Combine Framework and SwiftUI. This project is the final part of a Combine course I got from udemy. It was very useful as a beginner as it also uses SwiftUI in it.

## Issues

I had some problems because it is an old course. Although Hackersnew has close to 400 news reports, APICALL never shows them all. Although I reduced the incoming news to 50, I could only get 5 news at most. I will try to fix it in the future.
